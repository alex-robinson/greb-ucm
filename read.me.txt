A few notes on how to run the GREB model:

1) Compling: you need to compile the code with a FORTRAN compiler. Depending on the complier you may have some option to opitmize the performance (speed) of the model.

2) Maschine dependence: The code hase one line that you may need to change depending on your computer:

  integer            :: ireal     = 4         ! record length for IO (machine dependent)

you may need to change ireal = 1. On my MacBook Pro it needs to be ireal = 4, but on PCs it was mostly ireal=1.

3) Namelist: you need to set the input parameter in the namelist. You can try the unix script to compile and run the model with the namelist: greb.web-public.com

4) Performance: Without any optimization by the compiler the model runs on my MacBook Pro laptop 1yr simulation in about 30sec. On a standard PC with opitimization (paralellization) is runs 1yr simulation in less than 1sec

Good luck!
